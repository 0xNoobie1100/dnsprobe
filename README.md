# Installation Instructions
### From Source

DNSProbe requires go1.13+ to install successfully. Run the following command to get the repo - 

```bash
> go get -u -v github.com/projectdiscovery/dnsprobe/cmd
```

In order to update the tool, you can use -u flag with `go get` command.

### Resolving Domains

To query a list of domains, you can pass the list via stdin.

```bash

```

This will run the tool against domains in `domains.txt` and returns the results. The tool uses the resolvers specified with -s option to perform the queries or default system resolvers.
